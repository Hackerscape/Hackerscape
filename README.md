# Hackerscape

I started hackerscape because I love Runescape and I am also into programming/Java. I am not a very good programmer and this project will be a lot of fun for me. I have some fun ideas and minigames that I look forward to implementing, which I will outline below. If you are a programmer, Runescape enthusiast, Hacker, Gamer, Etc- I would love to hear from you or see you IN-Game! If you found this on Git-hub or somewhere else and you would like to participate in the development or just have questions, feel free to reach out to me at null.routed@outlook.com.

This rsps was created from a version of Project Insanity and there are a lot of bugs that will need to be worked out. If you are interested in resolving a few of them or have fixes for something- feel free to submit a pull request! To quote a very talented man: "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships." --Michael Jordan

# Known-Bugs/Issues/Additions

This is a list of things that are either broken, have an issue or will be Implemented at some time. A few of these I have some awesome ideas for and will go into detail in description. 

* NPC Animations
     * Found quite a few animations that are definately shoddy implementation. The attack animation seems to be warped sprites. 
     * Barrows Mini-game
          * Need to add a "Kill Count" to the screen so that people know how many of the brothers they have killed.
               * There is also an issue when you enter one of the tombs, upon leaving the mini-map no longer works. Will need to fix this. 
     * Shops
          * I am going to completely redisign the shops to better represent an economic environment. Prices are currently all over the place and shops seem to be missing some key items. 
     * Hunter
          * This skill needs some serious work, as well as the hunter skilling zone- going to be some big changes here. 
     * Drop Tables
          * Will need to sompletely rewrite drop tables to better suite the economy in-mind.
     * God Wars
          * Will need to rewrite a bit of this to add the "Followers" of the gods and setup a required amount of kills before being able to enter the gods room. 
     * Pest Control
          * Pest control needs a bit of work, very lazy version was included in the source. Portals need to be added to their respective locations and NPC Summoning needs to be added. 
     * Summoning Skill
